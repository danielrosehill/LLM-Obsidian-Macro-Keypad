# LLM Entry Macro Keypad - Idea And Plans

## First Notes

**Project Name**: **MacroFlow: Custom Keypad for LLM-Driven Note Management**

**Project Description**: MacroFlow is an open-source project focused on designing a programmable macro keypad layout tailored to streamline interactions with language models (LLMs) and optimize note capture workflows in Obsidian. Developed on a Fedora Linux system, the project establishes configurable key mappings that expedite LLM sessions, allowing users to record insights efficiently and keep their notes organized. By making MacroFlow open-source, the project aims to provide a customizable starting point for configuring a macro keypad that can be adapted to various note-taking and output capture setups.

**Initial Hotkey Ideas**:

Some key mappings may be configured within Obsidian, while others may involve system-level bindings. Initial hotkey suggestions include:

1. **Add a Prompt Heading**: Insert a heading format to start a new prompt, organizing inputs consistently.
2. **Add an Output Heading**: Label each response or output with a designated heading for clarity.
3. **Open New LLM Session**: Launch a new session with the LLM, allowing for quick conversation resets.
4. **Export to PDF**: Convert selected notes or outputs into a PDF format for easy sharing or offline access.
5. **Jump to Context Library**: Directly access a folder of background materials and references.
6. **Detach Current File in File Explorer**: Enable detachment of the current file in the file explorer to view it separately.
7. **Jump to Outputs Folder**: Quickly navigate to a dedicated folder for all LLM-generated outputs.
8. **Jump to Prompt Library**: Access a folder with frequently used prompts or templates.

MacroFlow is designed to be highly adaptable, inviting contributors to modify key mappings for different productivity and note management needs.
